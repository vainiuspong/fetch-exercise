Hi ___,

I'm reaching out to followup on the datasets you asked me to explore. 
Here are a few of the issues I found so far:

1. There are a lot of null values in the brands and receipts datasets. 
2. There are a significant amount of duplicates in the users and brands datasets.

How would you like to address these issues? First, there is a lot of cleanup and
further investigation that would be necessary to make this data trustworthy.
Second, I would recommend building a system that would be able to monitor for all these data quality issues 
and send automated alerts if anything goes wrong.

I would also be interested to learn exactly how the data will be used so that I can set it up to be most useful to you. Thanks!
